                Maybe I'm a dreamer<br>
                Maybe I'm a fool for you<br>
                But I think I'm a believer<br>
                I believe in something new<br>
                Maybe I'm a liar<br>
                But maybe I will tell the truth<br>
                I think we gotta hold on<br>
                And I hope it's not too late for us to change<br><br>
